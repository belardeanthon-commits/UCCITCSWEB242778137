        <h2>Story of Abel Iloko</h2>
        <p>
          The term <strong>“abel”</strong> in Ilocano means “to weave.” The resulting fabric, called <strong>inabel</strong>, is one of the most iconic and enduring handwoven textiles in the Philippines. 
          In Santiago, Ilocos Sur, local weavers continue to practice this ancient art, passing down techniques that date back to pre-colonial times.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the Spanish era, the exceptional quality of Ilocano abel was recognized throughout the region — its fine cotton was even used for galleon sails and royal clothing. 
          Today, the town of Santiago keeps this tradition alive through community-based weaving cooperatives and family workshops, where women skillfully create patterns on wooden pedal looms.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each abel design tells a story — from the <em>binakul</em> (whirlwind pattern) symbolizing protection, to the <em>pinilian</em> (brocade) that highlights the weaver’s artistry. 
          These fabrics are not only beautiful; they also represent the strength, patience, and creativity of the Ilocano people.
        </p>

        <p>
          Abel weaving continues to shape Santiago’s cultural identity, attracting tourists and sustaining livelihoods. 
          By supporting local abel products, visitors help preserve a craft that weaves together the community’s past, present, and future.
